    Attendee Details and FAQ
  %h3 What should I bring?
  %p
    St. Dorothy's Rest provides linens, towels, and meals, so you just need to bring the essentials:
  %ul
    %li A laptop + charger for the code retreat
    %li Clothes (layers are good, California is often cold)
    %li Toiletries
  %p If you happen to have an extra keyboard and mouse, please bring them. They will come in very handy at the code retreat.
  %h3 When should I be there?
  %p
    The conference will run
    %b Friday, August 14th at 6pm
    through
    %b Sunday, August 16th at 7pm;
    the camp will be open on Sunday night for anyone who wants to stay through Monday morning.
  %h3 How do I get there?
  %p
    We recommend flying into SFO, since weâ€™ll help arranged shared transportation from the San Francisco area.
    OAK and STS airports are slightly closer, but you may need to figure out your own transportation to and from the venue.
  %p
    St. Dorothy's Rest is about a 2.5 hour drive north from SFO in average traffic. We're currently looking into whether
    renting a shuttle bus or coordinating carpooling will make more sense, but rest assured, we'll help you figure out
    how to get out to &:conf.
  %h3 Is there internet or cell service?
  %p
    Come expecting to disconnect and recharge. There is limited wifi in the main
    house so you'll probably be able to check your email now and then, but don't
    expect to be video conferencing into that 8am status meeting. AT&T and Verizon
    have towers in the area, but the hills may prevent you from getting a strong mobile signal.
  %h3 What is a code retreat?
  %p
    A code retreat is a day of pair programming, preferably using test-driven development, where you work on
    #{ link_to "the same problem", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" } over and over with different
    pairs and different restrictions as the day progresses.
    (The individual restrictions are a surprise! But they could include no if statements, no using the mouse, only four lines
    per method, and more silliness.) Each hour, you delete your code and pair up with someone new.
  %p
    You can bring any language to the code retreat, but it works best if you're set up to write tests. Each pair should
    have at least one member who is familiar with the language and testing framework you'll be using. You won't
    have time to set up new dev environment during the code retreat, so if there's something new you want to try out,
    be sure to get everything installed before &:conf.

  %h3 What is an unconference?
  %p
    An unconference is an attendee-driven event where people self-organize into groups to discuss a common topic. At &:conf,
    we'll be breaking the topics into two main tracks, Yak and Hak (thanks,
    #{ link_to "Ruby DCamp", "http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/articles/2012/10/06/the-dcamp-manifesto/"}!). But there could
    be more tracks, depending on the collective will of the &:conf community.
  %p
    On Saturday night, we'll decide which specific topics to include, and then on Sunday we'll have 30 minute sessions on the topics
    that get the most votes. (This will probably be done with sticky notes and dot stickers.)

  %p
    The person who suggests a topic is usually a facilitator, but aren't necessarily a subject-matter
    expert. We expect many of the sessions to be round-table discussions, but they might also involve short
    presentations or demos, a short workshops, or something completely different!
