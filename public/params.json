Saturday’s code retreat will be a day of pair programming on one kata where each hour we throw our code away and work with a new person. Sunday’s unconference will have two tracks: yak and hack, where we'll talk about technologies, programming, careers, and culture. \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nQuestions? Interested in sponsoring?
